# Issue Tracker API

A FastAPI-based RESTful API for managing issues with support for filtering, sorting, and input validation. This API demonstrates clean architecture, versioning, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete issues  
- Filter issues by `status` and `priority`  
- Sort issues by `priority`, `created_at`, or `updated_at`  
- API versioning (`v1`) for future-proofing  
- Input validation using Pydantic enums  
- Comprehensive pytest test coverage
